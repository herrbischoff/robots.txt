A sane, minimal robots.txt file (for the western world)

You're unlikely to need any other crawlers on your site to be found. If you
have special requirements or need/want to use local search engines, this is
probably more of a starting point for you.

As this blocks all but the excepted user agents, it should plainly identify
crawlers that do not respect the settings.
